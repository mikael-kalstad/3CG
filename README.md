# SU3 - 3CG

**A web-based application for analyzing ECG-signals in 3D.**

The application can be tried <a href="https://williad.pages.stud.idi.ntnu.no/su3-3cg/" target="_blank">here</a>.

This team project was an university project in the subject <em>TDAT3022 Systemutviklingsprosjekt</em> assigned by Infiniwell AS. The project lasted a semester, where we went through all the stages of developing an application. This project had focus on experimenting with different ways of visualizing ECG-signals in 3D. The project was a pre-project to the bachelors thesis, therefore a research question was developed; "Can 3D-visualization of ECG-waves be favorable?" (NOTE, this is a translation of the norwegian research question: "Kan 3D-visualisering av EKG-bølgeformer være gunstig?"

# What I learned
### Soft skills
- Working with an external client (Infiniwell AS).
- Having more responsibility for finding solutions and meeting deadlines.

### Technical
  #### Front-end
- Designing UI for 3D.
- Developing 3D elements with react and threejs.

#### Back-end
- More complex algorithms for manipulating several UI elements synchronously.  
- Using a store in a react project.


#### Other
- Extensive documentation when working on a project of this degree. 


### Screenshots

A screenshot showing the split view functionality. The first visualization is a normal 12-channel ECG wave, the second is a visualization called VCG (Vectorcardiography), and the third is an experimental visualization made by William Dalheim called Circle visualization. (Experimenting with different visualization was a part of this project). <br/><br/>
